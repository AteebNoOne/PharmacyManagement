# PharmacyManagement
I saw this pharmacy management simple code somewhere on internet where a user come and buy a particular medicine and the program ends,
So i upgraded this program to a complete login register system through flat file system. 
I guess all of the functions are totally working and I still know some of the errors it shows like it wont get any login if you run this first but close and run again
So it will get all the logins. I can fix this problem too that's really about changing line of codes guess you must try it. In this program we have admin panel which
can change stocks add users remove users and check logs while on other side we have a employee or pharmacist login who can sell medicines. 
Admin login username : 16417 Admin login passwords : ateeb.
Employees Usernames : 18634,18953 Employee Passwords: hammad,shiza (respectively)
This program will help you learn shell script and it will be really helful for academic assignments.
